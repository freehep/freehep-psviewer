(In every period there have been better or worse\
 types employed in better or worse ways. The\
 better types employed in better ways have been\
 used by the educated printer acquainted with\
 standards and history, directed by taste and\
 a sense of the fitness of things, and facing the\
 industrial conditions and the needs of his time.\
 Such men have made of printing an art. The\
 poorer types and methods have been employed\
 by printers ignorant of standards and caring\
 alone for commercial success. To these, printing\
 has been simply a trade. The typography of a\
 nation has been good or bad as one or other of\
 these classes had the supremacy. And to-day\
 any intelligent printer can educate his taste, so\
 to choose types for his work and so to use them,\
 that he will help printing to be an art rather\
 than a trade. \261Daniel Berkeley Updike.)

% EXERCISE FOR THE READER:  If the user specifies a short
% enough line length, it is possible for the typeset width 
% of a single word to exceed the maximum line length.  
% Modify this algorithm to handle this event gracefully.
